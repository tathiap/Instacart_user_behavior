# Instacart Customer Behavior Analysis
Production scale behavioral analytics demonstrating workforce adjacent capabilities: retention forecasting, segmentation, causal inference, and SQL-based operational reporting across 3M+ transactions.


## Why This Matters for Workforce Management
This project demonstrates analytical capabilities directly applicable to workforce planning and operational analytics:

  **1. Retention & Attrition Forecasting**
 
   **Workforce Parallel:**  Just as customers churn, employees attrit—forecasting methods apply to both domains.
 
   **What I Did:**
   * Built retention funnels tracking user progression through order milestones (1→2→3→6+ orders)
     
   * Identified Week 1 as critical retention window (35% drop-off after first order)
     
   * Applied Prophet & ARIMA to forecast weekly demand patterns with proper evaluation metrics


 ** WFM Application: ** 
 
   * Predict employee attrition 3-6 months ahead to support proactive hiring

   * Forecast service volume to inform staffing capacity models

   * Identify critical retention milestones (90-day, 6-month, 1-year)
